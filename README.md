# Hardware
This clover setting should works for recent Alienware Aurora R7 desktops  (released on 2017 and 2018) which installed with Intel CPU and Nvidia GPU. It may need some minor modifications to completely fulfill your machine.

The hardware details for my machine: i7-8700, GTX 1080, Adata sx8200 480g nvme ssd, DW1830 wifi+bluetooth

# Working condition:
I connect two 4k monitor to the machine through GTX1080 display ports, they works good. 

Sleep and wake work good.

Usb ports are injected through SSDT-USB.aml

I do not use Intel integrated GPU, so it's not tested. 

I have no related devices, so I did not test the SD-Card reader, USB-C ports and HDMI ports. I use 

Killer 1535 Wifi+bluetooth not work (need to be replaced)
